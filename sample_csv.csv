To help ensure a smooth transition of her responsibilities while also reducing costs for the Company over the long term, Ms. Walters-Hoffert and the Company agreed that she will transition to a consulting role with the Company.

Pursuant to a transition agreement we entered into with Mr. Fair on January 26, 2024, Mr. Fair will transition from full-time to part-time status, effective April 1, 2024.

During the Transition Period, Mr. Fair’s base salary, which is currently an annualized amount of $386,000, will be reduced by 25%.

Daniel Hobbs, executive vice president and chief financial officer of the Company. The Indemnification Agreement supplements indemnification provisions already contained in the Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (as amended) and Amended and Restated By-Laws and generally provides that the Company shall indemnify Mr. Hobbs to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, subject to certain exceptions, against expenses, judgments, fines and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with his service as an officer and also provides for rights to advancement of expenses and contribution. On January 25, 2024, the Company and Simmons Bank entered into an Executive Change in Control Severance Agreement (“CIC Agreement”) with Mr. Hobbs. The CIC Agreement provides Mr. Hobbs with termination compensation if (1) Mr. Hobbs’ employment is involuntarily terminated without “cause” (as defined in the CIC Agreement) either (a) on or after the date a change in control of the Company occurs or (b) within 180 days immediately preceding the date a change in control of the Company occurs, or (2) a change in control occurs and Mr. Hobbs voluntarily terminates his employment within six months following a “trigger event” (as defined in the CIC Agreement). For purposes of the CIC Agreement, a “change in control” includes a change in ownership or effective control of the Company, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, each as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5). For purposes of the CIC Agreement, “termination compensation” means two times the sum of (1) Mr. Hobbs’ annual base salary as of his termination date and (2) the greater of (a) the average of any annual cash incentive award paid or payable to Mr. Hobbs for the Company’s last two completed fiscal years prior to his employment termination or (b) Mr. Hobbs’ target annual cash incentive award opportunity for the year in which Mr. Hobbs’ employment termination occurs. In order to receive termination compensation under the CIC Agreement, Mr. Hobbs must also execute a release of claims. The CIC Agreement provides that Mr. Hobbs may elect to continue any life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment coverage, provided that Mr. Hobbs will be responsible for payment of any premiums on any such continued coverage elected. The CIC Agreement has a three-year term that automatically renews for additional one-year periods unless the Company elects to terminate; provided that in the event of a change in control of the Company, if the CIC Agreement is still in effect, the CIC Agreement’s term will be amended to two years beginning on the date of the change in control. On January 25, 2024, the Company also entered into a Deferred Compensation Agreement (“DC Agreement”) with Mr. Hobbs. The DC Agreement provides for a monthly benefit following Mr. Hobbs’ retirement equal to one-twelfth of thirty percent of the average of Mr. Hobbs’ base salary for the five years immediately preceding his retirement, payable for 180 months. The benefit under the DC Agreement will be funded by the Company, and Mr. Hobbs will not be required or permitted to make contributions for his benefit. The benefit vests at age 60, subject to earlier vesting upon death, disability, or a change in control of the Company. The benefit becomes payable upon the earliest to occur of (i) Mr. Hobbs’ retirement at or after age 60, (ii) his death, (iii) his disability, or (iv) his separation from service after",SIMMONS FIRST NATIONAL CORP (SFNC),2024-01-26
